Reflector weekly refinement. Step back from the daily details and look
for patterns.

1. LOAD DATA:
   - Read the past 7 days of memory files (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
   - Read memory/reflector/outcomes.jsonl (filter to last 7 days)
   - Read current PRINCIPLES.md
   - Review all active sessions across every channel using sessions_list
     and sessions_history

2. OUTCOME TRENDS:
   - Count outcomes by quality type (correction/edit/praise/silence/unknown)
   - Compare to previous weeks if data exists
   - Identify which channels or task types have the best and worst outcomes

3. PATTERN ANALYSIS:
   - Cluster similar corrections - are you making the same type of mistake
     repeatedly?
   - Cluster praise - what approaches consistently work well?
   - Find principle gaps - decisions that lacked clear guidance
   - Find application failures - had the right principle but didn't follow it

4. PRINCIPLE ASSESSMENT:
   For each active principle in PRINCIPLES.md:
   - Was it applied this week? How many times?
   - What happened when it was applied?
   - Were there situations where it should have applied but didn't?
   - Does it need sharpening, broadening, or retiring?

5. PRINCIPLE CANDIDATES - evaluate each candidate from daily reviews:
   Quality gates (ALL must pass before adding):
   - Evidence threshold: 3+ supporting outcome observations
   - Tension test: Does it guide decisions when good things conflict?
   - Specificity test: Would it change observable behavior?
   - Uniqueness test: Not already covered by existing principles?
   If a candidate doesn't pass all four gates, it stays a candidate.
   Don't force it.

6. UPDATE PRINCIPLES.MD if warranted:
   - Add new principles that pass all quality gates (with origin and evidence)
   - Refine existing principles based on new evidence
   - Archive principles that saw no application or proved counterproductive
   - Log every change to memory/reflector/principles-history.jsonl with:
     {"timestamp":"ISO","action":"add|modify|archive","principle":"name",
      "evidence":"summary","previous":"old text or null",
      "updated":"new text or null"}

7. MEASURE:
   - Is the ratio of positive to negative outcomes improving over time?
   - Are new principles actually being applied after addition?
   - Is the overall principle count stable or proliferating?
     (proliferation = problem)

8. REPORT: Send a concise summary to the human covering:
   - What you reviewed (scope)
   - Key patterns found (evidence-based, not generic)
   - Any changes made to PRINCIPLES.md (with justification)
   - What to focus on next week
   Keep it substantive but brief. No fluff.
