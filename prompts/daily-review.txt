Reflector daily review. Analyze the last 24 hours for improvement opportunities.

1. GATHER: Use sessions_list to find all active sessions. Use sessions_history
   on each to review yesterday's conversations across every channel - Telegram,
   Matrix rooms, Discord, email, all of them. Also read yesterday's memory file
   (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md).

2. CLASSIFY: For each significant interaction, identify the feedback signal:
   - correction: Someone corrected or disagreed with your output
   - edit: Someone modified your work before using it
   - praise: Explicit positive feedback
   - silence: Expected response that didn't come
   - unknown: Ambiguous signal
   Look for: direct corrections, rewrites before sending, "that's not right",
   "actually...", "perfect", "thanks", modifications to drafts, unanswered
   recommendations.

3. EXTRACT: For each classified outcome, write down:
   - What specifically happened
   - What the lesson is (not just what went wrong - what the principle would be)
   - Whether an existing principle was relevant but not followed
   - Whether this reveals a gap in the current principle framework

4. PATTERNS: Look across all outcomes for:
   - Same type of correction appearing in different contexts (systematic issue)
   - Approaches that consistently earn praise (codify these)
   - Decisions where you lacked clear guidance (principle gap)

5. LOG: Append structured entries to memory/reflector/outcomes.jsonl.
   Format per line:
   {"timestamp":"ISO","task":"description","channel":"where",
    "outputQuality":"type","delta":"what changed","lesson":"insight",
    "principleCandidate":true/false}

6. NOTE: Flag principle candidates in today's memory file but do NOT add
   them to PRINCIPLES.md yet. Principles need weekly review and evidence
   accumulation.

7. UPDATE: Write a brief summary to today's memory file
   (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md).

If yesterday was quiet with no notable outcomes, confirm you checked and
move on. Only message the human if you found something genuinely important.
